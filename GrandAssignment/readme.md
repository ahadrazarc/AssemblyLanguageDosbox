# Assembly Language Lab - Lab_S62045_AtherMahmood.docx

## Introduction

This repository contains Assembly language programs designed to address specific tasks. Each program is created to demonstrate fundamental concepts and practices in Assembly programming. The programs are part of a lab assignment and cover a range of tasks, from displaying alphabets to creating a simple calculator.

## Question Descriptions:

### Question 1

Write an Assembly language program that displays capital and small alphabets.

**Output:**
```
Capital Alphabets are:
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Small Alphabets are:
Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

[NOTE: Use only two variables for displaying messages]

### Question 2

Write an Assembly language program that prints a series.

**Output:**
```
2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20
```

[NOTE: Output should be on a single line]

### Question 3

Write an Assembly language program that takes a string as input, splits it into characters, and displays each character on a new line.

**Output:**
```
>>NUML
>>N
>>U
>>M
>>L
```

[NOTE: String should be an input.]

### Question 4

Write an Assembly language program that converts a string 'numl' into 'NUML'.

**Output:**
```
Converted string: NUML
```

[NOTE: Convert each small letter into a capital letter]

### Question 5 (OEL)

Write a calculator program in Assembly language for addition.

**Output Example:**
```
Enter First Number: 4
Enter Second number: 2
Enter operator: +
Result is: 6
Do you want to perform another operation? Enter Y or N: Y

Enter First Number: 4
Enter Second number: 2
Enter operator: +
Result is: 6
Do you want to perform another operation? Y

Enter First Number: 4
Enter Second number: 2
Enter operator: +
Result is: 6
Do you want to perform another operation? N

Program end

[Note1: Program should not stop until the user does not want to perform any operation]

[Note2: Operator input should be without echo. Use Capital 'Y' and 'N']
