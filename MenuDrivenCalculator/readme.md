# Menu-Driven Calculator in Assembly Language (DOSBox)

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Menu-Driven Calculator project! This project is an implementation of a simple calculator using Assembly Language, specifically designed to run on DOSBox. The calculator provides a user-friendly menu interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, making it a handy tool for quick calculations.

## Features

1. **Menu Interface**: The calculator presents a menu-driven interface, making it easy for users to navigate and choose the desired operation.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. **Error Handling**: The program includes error handling to ensure that users enter valid inputs. It provides informative messages in case of invalid inputs or operations.

4. **User-Friendly**: The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly calculator that is intuitive to use, even for those unfamiliar with Assembly Language.

## Requirements

- **DOSBox**: This project is designed to run on DOSBox, a DOS emulator that allows you to run old DOS applications on modern systems.
